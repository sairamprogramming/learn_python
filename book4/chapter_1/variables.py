# Program is a simple demonstration of variables in python.

# Variable Assignment.
a = 100         # An integer assignment.
b = 1000.0      # A floating point.
name = 'John'   # A string.

print(a)
print(b)
print(name)

# Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.

a = b = c = 1

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables.

a, b, c = 1, 2 , "Tom"

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
